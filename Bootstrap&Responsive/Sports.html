            <h3>India lost to Sri lanka to level the T20I series at 1-1.</h3>
            <h4>Low scoring encounters often tend to become thrillers. The game today was no different. Even though the game seemed to slipping past Sri Lanka’s reach, they always found a way to come back and strike boundaries at crucial intervals. The misfields, dropped catches and extras didn’t help India’s case either. India’s debutants failed to mark a mark, more so with the bat. In comparison, India seemed more bothered with the slow nature of the surface, although there was poor shot selection in some cases.</h4>

        <h3> Vidit Gujarati becomes the 2nd Indian after Vishy Anand to qualify for the World cup Quaterfinals</h3>
        <h4>Sochi: Indian Grandmaster Vidit Santosh Gujrathi played out a draw against Jan-Krzystof Duda in the first game of the quarter-finals of the FIDE Chess World Cup, in Sochi on Wednesday.

            The 26-year old India No 3 played the Catalan closed variation against the Polish opponent and signed peace in 33 moves.
            
            It was a solid game by both players with Duda managing to easily neutralise the Indian's first move advantage of the white pieces.
            
            Gujrathi tried his pet Catalan opening but Duda's good preparation helped him secure a draw.</h4>
